# Weather Outlook

## Description

This is a simple to use weather application that lets a user search for weather conditions of a city of their choice. The user types in the name of a city and clicks the `Search` button. Then the current weather for the searched city is displayed along with a 5-Day Forecast for the city. This application also saves the user's past city searches and displays them as buttons that the user can click to see a past city's weather conditions again.
